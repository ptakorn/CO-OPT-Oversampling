# Cluster Oversampling with Optimization (CO-OPT) Algorithm

## üìå Overview
This repository contains the Python implementation of the **Cluster Oversampling with Optimization (CO-OPT)** algorithm. CO-OPT extends the original COG method by allowing users to optimize based on any custom objective function (e.g., G-mean, F1-score, HPN) and use any scikit-learn compatible classifier. It is designed to adapt oversampling decisions dynamically for improved performance on imbalanced datasets.

The implementation supports flexible experimentation and is aligned with the methodology proposed in:
